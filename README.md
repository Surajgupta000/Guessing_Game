# Guessing_Game
This "Guess the Number" game challenges players to find a random number between 1-100. Each guess gives feedback: too high, too low, or invalid if out of range. Attempts are tracked, and on a correct guess, "Congratulations!" displays. The game auto-resets after 5 seconds for another round, encouraging improved guessing each time.
